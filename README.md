## Hi there 👋

<!--
**xpcello/xpcello** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its README.md (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a tool to help people organize their desks using math, called **Drawersmith**. I'm also playing my cello 🎻.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **HTML** and **CSS**, exploring frameworks and diving into frontend development.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects**, **team efforts**, and **anything where I can lend a hand or learn something new**.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with debugging my code, sage advice, and creating a **volunteer SaaS site** (still figuring this out!).  
- 💬 Ask me about my hobbies! I play the **cello** and swim 🏊. I also know **UI and UX design** using Figma. My goals include launching a few startups by the end of high school and having some successful ones 🚀.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email](mailto:contact@xavierp.me) | [X/Twitter](https://x.com/xpcello) | My site (under construction 🚧).  
- 😄 Pronouns: **he/him**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I haven’t worn sweatpants to school once this year — pretty impressive for America, right? 🇺🇸
